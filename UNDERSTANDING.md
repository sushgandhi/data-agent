# Data Agent - Project Understanding

## Overview
Data Agent is an interactive data analysis platform that allows users to analyze and visualize data through natural language conversations. The system acts as an intelligent agent that can understand user queries about their data and provide relevant insights, visualizations, and analysis.

## Core Components

### 1. FastAPI Runner Service (Current Focus)
- Primary backend service responsible for:
  - Data processing and management
  - LLM integration for natural language understanding
  - Code generation and execution
  - Result management and response formatting

### 2. External Dependencies and Integrations
- **LLM Service** (e.g., OpenAI GPT)
  - Will be used for:
    - Understanding natural language queries
    - Generating Python code for analysis
    - Improving error responses
  - Required: API key and endpoint configuration

### 3. Data Processing Capabilities
- File formats supported:
  - CSV
  - Excel
- Storage requirements:
  - Temporary file storage (local for initial implementation)
  - Metadata storage (in-memory for initial implementation)
  - Future expansion to S3 or similar object storage

### 4. Analysis Features
- Descriptive analysis
- Data visualization
- Statistical analysis
- Basic predictive analysis
- Interactive query refinement

## Technical Constraints
- Local development environment initially
- Sandboxed code execution environment
- Memory management for data processing
- Secure code execution practices

## Data Flow
1. Data Ingestion → Metadata Extraction → Storage
2. Query Reception → LLM Processing → Code Generation
3. Code Execution → Result Capture → Response Formatting
4. Error Handling → LLM-based Correction → User Feedback

## Security Considerations
- Sandboxed code execution
- Input validation
- Resource usage limits
- Error handling and logging

## Future Considerations
- Scaling to cloud infrastructure
- Persistent storage implementation
- User authentication and authorization
- Session management
- Enhanced error recovery
